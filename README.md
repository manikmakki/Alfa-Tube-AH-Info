# Alfa-Tube-AH-Info
Dump of configs and docs for the Alfa Tube-AH

# Gettings Started 
[Docs for AHM27292U](https://docs.alfa.com.tw/Product/AHM27292U/), while not explicitly for the Tube-AH, this is the module installed inside the Tube-AH via PCI -> NVME adapter.<br>
[Factory Firmware DL from Alfa](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KSlgDL66AJUVrZjVxHLGtyePOj-y7iDj/view?usp=share_link) At this time, there is no firmware on [Alfa's website](https://files.alfa.com.tw/). This link was provided by their customer support team<br>
**NOTE**: The firmware above boots, but appears to be lacking the nessecary drivers and kernel modules to support the nrc7292 chipset<br>
This is the reason I am uploading everything from a fresh device, in case it helps sombeody else.
